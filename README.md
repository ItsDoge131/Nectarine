<b>Nectarine</b> is a modern, open-source Nintendo Switch emulator.  
It began as a fork of Yuzu but has grown into its own project, focused on clarity, portability, and comfort-first development.  
We maintain builds for Windows, Linux, and Android, with an emphasis on clean design and accessible workflows.
